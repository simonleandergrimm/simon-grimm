   description: "Will Bradshaw and I outline how to think about the benefits and drawbacks of different sampling strategies for the early detection of asymptomatically spreading pathogens. Frameworks like the ones discussed in the report are used by the NAO to assess various sampling strategies, like wastewater or swab sampling."
